cookies by choosing the cookie-disabling function, User may be

required to re-enter information on the Platform more often and
certain features of the Platform may be unavailable.</p>

prevent unauthorized access to the Platform, to maintain data
accuracy and to ensure the correct use of the information raulson
hold. No data transmission over the internet or any wireless network
can be guaranteed to be perfectly secure. As a result, while raulson
tries to protect the information it holds, raulson cannot guarantee the
security of any information the User transmits to raulson and Users
do so at their own risk.</p>
<p style="font-weight:bold;">8. DATA RETENTING</p>

information is processed ‘as is’. You may access, correct, and update
your personal information directly through the functionalities

not be retroactive and will be in accordance with the terms of this
Privacy Policy, related terms of use, and applicable laws. In the event
you withdraw the consent given to us under this Privacy Policy, such
withdrawal may hamper your access to the Platform or restrict the
provision of our services to you for which raulson consider that
information to be necessary.</p>
<p style="font-weight:bold;">9. USER&#39;S RIGHTS</p>
<p style="margin-left: 470px;">raulson retains your personal information in accordance with
applicable laws, for a period no longer than is required for the
purpose for which it was collected or as required under any
applicable law. However, raulson may retain data related to you if it
believes it may be necessary to prevent fraud or future abuse, to
enable udaan to exercise its legal rights and/or defend against legal
claims or if required by law or for other legitimate purposes. udaan

and research purposes.</p>

immediately. Your continued use of the Platform shall be deemed to
be your acceptance to the provisions of the Privacy Policy. User
